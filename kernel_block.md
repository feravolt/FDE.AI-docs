## About kernel block
Some kernels are blocking most of known optimizers including some apps by preventing their instalaltion/execution.<br>
Why do kernel devs do this? For various reasons. Some are sick of false user reports in conflicting situations, some just hate optimizers and/or think they're doing better, some just blindly copy commits from others not even knowing why.<br>
Whatever. This file is created NOT in order to ashame or abuse anyone, but for answering all that "will this kernel work with FDE.AI" questions.<br>

This is the list of kernels which I found and are blocking optimizers. If you want to use FDE.AI - don't use any of this kernels and switch to a better one.<br><br>

 I am not going to update this list frequently. You can find out if kernel has blocker or not by your own this way:
 - Find a source code repo of your kernel. If dev doesn't provided source code for it's kernel - change your kernel to a better one straight away.
 - Once you found kernel source, search for "com.feravolt" keyword in that repo, also check your defconfig file for "CONFIG_BLOCK_UNWANTED_FILES=Y".
 
 If any of theese from above matches for you - "congratulations", kernel dev decided to block "unwanted" apps for you. In such case, consider avoiding such kernel if you wish to have freedom of what to do with your system and be able to use FDE.AI inclusive. OR you may try to use FDE.AI-as-system-app Magisk module from releases page.
